# Todo

_Write (done) next to completed tasks_

## Pathing: 
1. Build new curve method using rotation matrix (done)
2. Construct curve around object using final curve method (done)
3. Merge Curve algorithm (doneish)
4. Add in Plucker coordinate calculation (done)
5. Build collision detection using Plucker coordinates (done)
6. Translate and rotate curves to correct position (done)
7. Build a main function to control the logic
8. Build the module (not doing)
9. Camera Controls (done)
10. Write up formula sheet
11. Log mode (Not doing)

NOTES:
Switch to quaternions they are more reliable
Calculation of yaw and pitch can be off and not necessarily trustworthy
Camera is not super smooth and could be tweeked
Sometimes an autogenerated curve leaks into another curve

## Node: 
1. Add in stubs (done)
2. Seperate things into concrete functions (done)
3. Documentation (done)
4. Define API behavior functions (done)

## Controls:
1. Style (DONE)
2. Move Labels (done)

## Python: 
1. Add in Bayes curve algorithm (not going to be done)
2. Define stub behavior (done)
3. ??? (Tom add stuff in here)

## Serial: 
1. Define stub behavior (done)
2. Documentation (done)
3. Seperate multiple out sensors from command process (done)
4. ??? (Tom add stuff in here)
